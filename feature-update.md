overall its pretty good, just just minor tweaks for ux/ui. 

resume; why do you have two resumes for two different things? who is the audience for this website? is it customer service or is it software. I think there should only be one resume, and a consolidated one too. Also idk but maybe if you decide to only have one, you might not need a new page for it. you can just code the resume into the page it self and then have an icon in case they wanna view it as a pdf tooo

Interacivde mode is super cool. But the cta for to go back to standard mode is not in the same spot as the interactive mode before, id say move the cta for standard mode in the same spot for consistency.

About me; the speaker icon to pronounce your name is a good idea, but when I click on it there is a delay which makes me think that the speaker is not working. Perhaps 1. add a loading animation when I press the speaker or 2. decrease the delay time. Also you can add placeholder text under each field

about me; the skills you added look like buttons

My journey is very cool; I think you should add a cta under about me to help navigate someone here. or include it there (not sure though). Also, maybe improve the graphics, its like you made it in ms paint lol

For your logo on the top left and name, the colours are different

Dark mode, don't use brown as the surrounding colour for the background, not good for contrast/accesssibilty. your green CTAs like interactive mode are blending in with the green background. also its dark mode, why is it black/grey why is it green and brown? this is more like green and brown mode lmao

your journey page should include the same nav bar and footer as all other pages

buttons like send msg don't have that clickable cursor on it, even though its clickable. it should have it , like your other cta for resume and stuff. if its a button, make it seem and feel like a button
